# Drop-Tower-Unity
**What is Drop-Tower?**
I used to play this Java game on my dad's Nokia phone back in late 2000s. I can't remember the name but I do remember the objectives, create a tower by placing oscillating blocks on each other. What better way than to remember a game than to remake it yourself right? And what faster engine than Unity.
